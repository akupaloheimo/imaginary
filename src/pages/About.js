        Welcome to "Reclaimed Worlds: Nature’s Return" – A Journey to Abandoned
      </marquee>
      <h1>About Us</h1>
      <p className="left-align">
        Places In 1995, a failed theme park was left to nature in an
        unprecedented experiment. Rather than demolish the remnants of human
        ambition, the founders of this project made a bold decision: to simply
        walk away. For 30 years, no human set foot inside.<br></br>
        <br></br>The goal? To witness what happens when the built environment is
        surrendered to the forces of time and nature. Now, after three decades
        of complete abandonment, we invite you to step into a world transformed.
        "Reclaimed Worlds: Nature’s Return" is not just an exhibition—it is a
        living testament to nature’s power to heal, reshape, and reclaim.
        Buildings have crumbled under the weight of vines, concrete has cracked
        beneath the persistent push of roots, and wildlife has returned to a
        space once designed for human entertainment.<br></br>
        <br></br>This exhibition challenges visitors to rethink the relationship
        between humans and the spaces we create. It asks: What happens when we
        let go? What does a world without human interference look like? And
        ultimately, how can we learn from this transformation?<br></br>
        <br></br>
        "Reclaimed Worlds: Nature’s Return" is now open to visitors. Come
        witness the astonishing resilience of nature and experience a space
        where human presence is no longer the defining force. To ensure the
        continued protection of this unique environment, all visits are
        conducted through private guided tours, and visitors are required to
        wear protective suits. This ensures minimal impact while allowing an
        intimate and respectful encounter with a world reclaimed by nature.
