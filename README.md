## An aesthetic experiemnt and experience
Our job was to create an imaginary garden with a very loose definition, we invented an exhibiton that has been taken over by nature and this website serves as the info and ticket page for the exhibiton. We had a lot of fun making this project and I spent a lot of time working on the CSS styling to make the website appear older.
